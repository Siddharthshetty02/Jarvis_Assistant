Voice based AI assistant and can take input from texts too

# 🧠 Jarvis AI Chatbot

Jarvis is a voice-activated AI assistant built with Python and Streamlit, inspired by Iron Man’s Jarvis. It can listen to your voice commands, respond intelligently using an AI model, speak replies aloud, and even perform basic tasks via your browser — all through a clean and interactive web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 **Speech Recognition**: Listens and converts your voice to text in real-time.
- 💬 **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses LLMs (like GPT or DeepSeek) to generate intelligent replies.
- 🔊 **Voice Output**: Speaks the responses back using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
- 🌐 **Browser Automation**: Opens websites or performs tasks based on commands.
- 🖥️ **Streamlit UI**: Runs in your browser with a modern dark-themed interface.
